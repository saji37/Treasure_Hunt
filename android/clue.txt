As I sat on the weathered bench, I couldn't help but reflect on the simple joys of life and the beauty that surrounds us, often unnoticed in our busy lives. It was a moment of serenity, a reminder to pause and appreciate the world's small wonders. Wait a second... You are in wrong Folder, Get back and solve it again.
